        <div>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl">1 . What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
        <p class="mt-3 px-5 text-justify"><span class="font-semibold text-2xl mx-2">Answer :</span></p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">DOM stands for Document Object Model.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">All HTML webpages are referred to as documents. The Document Object Model represents each of these web pages in a tree like structure to make it easier to access and manage the elements.Because of it , programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects, that way, programming languages can interact with the page.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">The Document Object Model is significant in speeding up web page loads.</p>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl">2 . How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>

        <p class="mt-3 px-5 text-justify"><span class="font-semibold text-2xl mx-2">Answer :</span></p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">There are 5 ways to select elements in a DOM using selectors.They are given below :</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">They are given in below :</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-9 text-justify">1 . querySelector() - It returns the first element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, null is returned.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-9 text-justify">2 . querySelectorAll() - It returns a static NodeList representing a list of the document's elements that match the specified group of selectors.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-9 text-justify">3 . getElementById() - It returns an element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-9 text-justify">4 . getElementsByClassName() - This method returns a collection of elements with a specified class name(s),returns an HTMLCollection and property is read-only.</p>

        <!--third question  -->

    </div>

        <div class="mt-10">

        <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl">3 . What is event bubble?</h2>

        <p class="mt-3 px-5 text-justify"><span class="font-semibold text-2xl mx-2">Answer :</span></p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">When an element like a button is clicked, an event is directed to the element, if an event handler is set for the element, the event  handler is triggered.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">In bubbling, when an event happens, the handler of the innermost element runs,  then the event bubbles up to the elements parent. If an event handler is set for the parent, this event handler is triggered and then the further ancestor elements. In other words, events bubble up or propagate the DOM tree upwards.</p>
    </div>

    <!--fourth question  -->

        <div class="mt-10">

        <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl">4 . What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
        <p class="mt-3 px-5 text-justify"><span class="font-semibold text-2xl mx-2">Answer :</span></p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 px-7 text-justify">JavaScript runs code sequentially in top-down order. However, there are some cases that code runs after something else happens and also not sequentially. Callback function make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It keeps us safe from problems and errors.</p>
